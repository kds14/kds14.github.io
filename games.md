## Velsa's Curse ##
<a name="velsas-curse"></a>
This was a very ambitious cooperative multiplayer survival RPG that I worked on for about a year in a group of 3. It didn't work out in the end but I learned a lot along the way. I worked as a project manager, programmer, and a pixel artist.


The idea of the game was you joined a randomly generated town with some friends and then would defend it against a witch named Velsa would was summoning skeletons to attack it.

Some features of this game are: a procedurally generated world, goal oriented action planning (GOAP), client/server networking, and all the standard RPG features (stats, items, combat, etc.)

 *A randomly generated town that you must defend*


 ![Inventory]({{ "/assets/velsa/inventory.png" | absolute_url }})


 *Inventory with various items*


 ![Shop]({{ "/assets/velsa/shop.png" | absolute_url }})


 *A basic shop*


 ![Skeleton Attack]({{ "/assets/velsa/skele_attack.png" | absolute_url }})


 *Skeletons attacking the town at night*


 ![Velsa Attack]({{ "/assets/velsa/velsa1.png" | absolute_url }})


 *If you survive until day 3, Velsa attacks*
