## Velsa's Curse ##
This was a very ambitious cooperative multiplayer survival RPG that I worked on for about a year in a group of 3. It didn't work out in the end but I learned a lot along the way. I worked as a project manager, programmer, and a pixel artist.


The idea of the game was you joined a randomly generated town with some friends and then would defend it against a witch named Velsa would was summoning skeletons to attack it.

Some features of this game are: a procedurally generated world, goal oriented action planning (GOAP), client/server networking, and all the standard RPG features (stats, items, combat, etc.)

 *If you survive until day 3, Velsa attacks*


If you would like to try it out, a proof of concept web version can be found here: [Velsa's Curse](https://pcakes215.itch.io/velsas-curse) (No guarantee that it will run on every machine or browser.)

## Unnamed Card Game ##
This game is still in its early stages but it still has some solid underlying features. It currently has working multiplayer and the basics of a card game (randomized deck, playing cards, tweening animations similar to Hearthstone).

If you would like to try it out, an executable can be found here: [Card game](https://pcakes215.itch.io/card-game). Read the description on the page to see how to test it.

## Unnamed Tactics Game ##
This is a simple tactics RPG. It has everything a tactics game needs such as turn based combat, a working grid system, AI, and pathfinding.

 There is no build of this. However you can build it yourself with Unity with the source here: [Source](https://github.com/kds14/tatics-rpg). There is some better code that can be used for tactics games in a library that I am writing here: [Game Dev Library](https://github.com/kds14/GameLibrary).

## Ludum Dare ##
Ludum Dare is a game jam that takes place over 1 weekend. I have entered it twice early on in my programming learning.

I entered Ludum Dare 35 with a platformer called Protector of the Forest. It can be played here: [Protector of the Forest](https://agricola.itch.io/protector-of-the-forest). The source can be found here : [Source](https://github.com/kds14/LD35).

I entered Ludum Dare 36 with a puzzle game called Golden Ruins. It can be played here: [Golden Ruins](https://agricola.itch.io/golden-ruins). The source can be found here : [Source](https://github.com/kds14/LD36).
